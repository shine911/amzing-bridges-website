<p>The Millau Viaduct (French: le Viaduc de Millau, IPA: [vjadyk də mijo]) is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the gorge valley of the River Tarn near Millau in southern France. It is the tallest bridge in the world, with one mast's summit at 343.0 metres (1,125.3 ft) above the base of the structure. In a Franco-British partnership, it was designed by the English architect Sir Norman Foster and French structural engineer Michel Virlogeux, and as of May 2017 it is the twenty-second highest bridge deck in the world, being 270 metres (890 ft) between the road deck and the ground below.</p>

<p>The Millau Viaduct is part of the A75-A71 autoroute axis from Paris to Béziers and Montpellier. The cost of construction was approximately € 394 million. It was built over three years, formally inaugurated on 14 December 2004, and opened to traffic two days later on 16 December. The bridge has been consistently ranked as one of the great engineering achievements of all time, and received the 2006 Outstanding Structure Award from the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering.</p>

<h4>History</h4>
<p>In the 1980s, high levels of road traffic near Millau in the Tarn valley were causing congestion, especially in the summer due to holiday traffic on the route from Paris to Spain. A method of bypassing Millau had long been considered, not only to ease the flow and reduce journey times for long distance traffic, but also to improve the quality of access to Millau for its local businesses and residents. One of the solutions considered was the construction of a road bridge to span the river and gorge valley. The first plans for a bridge were discussed in 1987 by CETE, and by October 1991 the decision was made to build a high crossing of the River Tarn by a structure of around 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) in length. During 1993–1994, the government consulted with seven architects and eight structural engineers. During 1995–1996, a second definition study was made by five associated architect groups and structural engineers. In January 1995, the government issued a declaration of public interest to solicit design approaches for a competition.</p>

<p>In July 1996 the jury decided in favour of a cable-stayed design with multiple spans, as proposed by the Sogelerg consortium led by Michel Virlogeux and Norman Foster. The decision to proceed by grant of contract was made in May 1998; then in June 2000, the contest for the construction contract was launched, open to four consortia. In March 2001, Eiffage established the subsidiary Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau (CEVM), and was declared winner of the contest and awarded the prime contract in August.</p>

</ol>
<p>The fourth option was selected by <a class="mw-redirect" title="Ministerial decree" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_decree">ministerial decree</a> on 28 June 1989. It encompassed two possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>the high solution, envisaging a 2,500-metre-long (8,200&nbsp;ft) viaduct more than 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft) above the river;</li>
<li>the low solution, descending into the valley and crossing the river on a 200-metre-long (660&nbsp;ft) bridge, then a viaduct of 2,300 metres (7,500&nbsp;ft), extended by a tunnel on the <a title="Larzac" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larzac">Larzac</a> side.</li>
</ol>
<p>After long construction studies by the Ministry of Public Works, the low solution was abandoned because it would have intersected the <a title="Water table" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_table">water table</a>, had a negative impact on the town, cost more, and lengthened the driving distance. The choice of the 'high' solution was decided by ministerial decree on 29 October 1991.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated4_15-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millau_Viaduct#cite_note-autogenerated4-15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the choice of the high viaduct, five teams of <a title="Architect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect">architects</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Researcher" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Researcher">researchers</a> worked on a technical solution.

<br>
<h4>Construction</h4>
<p>Two weeks after the laying of the first stone on December 14, 2001, the workers started digging the deep shafts. There were four shafts per pylon; 15 metres (49&nbsp;ft) deep and 5 metres (16&nbsp;ft) in diameter, assuring the stability of the pylons. At the bottom of each pylon, a tread of 3&ndash;5 metres (10&ndash;16&nbsp;ft) in thickness was installed to reinforce the effect of the deep shafts. The 2,000 cubic metres (2,600&nbsp;cu&nbsp;yd) of concrete necessary for the treads was poured at the same time.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2017)">citation needed</span></a></em>]</sup></p>
<p>In March 2002, the pylons emerged from the ground. The speed of construction then rapidly increased. Every three days, each pylon increased in height by 4 metres (13&nbsp;ft). This performance was mainly due to <a title="Climbing formwork" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing_formwork">sliding shuttering</a>. Thanks to a system of shoe anchorages and fixed rails in the heart of the pylons, a new layer of concrete could be poured every 20 minutes.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2017)">citation needed</span></a></em>]</sup></p>
<p>The bridge road deck was constructed on land at the ends of the Viaduct, and rolled lengthwise from one pylon to the next, with eight temporary towers providing additional support. The movement was accomplished by a computer-controlled system of pairs of wedges under the deck; the upper and lower wedges of each pair pointing in opposite directions. These were hydraulically operated, and moved repeatedly in the following sequence: the lower wedge slides under the upper wedge, raising it to the roadway above, and then forcing the upper wedge still higher to lift the roadway. Both wedges move forward together, advancing the roadway a short distance. The lower wedge retracts from under the upper wedge, lowering the roadway and allowing the upper wedge to drop away from the roadway; the lower wedge then moves back all the way to its starting position. There is now a linear distance between the two wedges equal to the distance forward the roadway has just moved. The upper wedge moves backward, placing it further back along the roadway, adjacent to the front tip of the lower wedge and ready to repeat the cycle and advance the roadway by another increment. It worked at 600 millimetres (24&nbsp;in) per cycle which was roughly four minutes long.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2017)">citation needed</span></a></em>]</sup></p>
<p>The mast pieces were driven over the new road deck lying down horizontally. The pieces were joined to form the one complete mast, still lying horizontally. The mast was then tilted upwards, as one piece, at one time in a tricky operation. In this way, each mast was erected on top of the corresponding concrete pylon. The stays connecting the masts and the deck were then installed, and the bridge was tensioned overall, and weight tested. After this, the temporary pylons could be removed.</p>
